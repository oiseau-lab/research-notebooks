# About
This repository intends to host public-facing information on research notebook project(s) at the University of Manchester, using GitHub Pages to generate a website.

# Reproduction
*  If you wish to run the Jupyter notebook `PlotAndPageGenerationForInterviews.ipynb`, which is used to generate plots and define some of the site structure and formatting, you will be able to do so by setting up a conda :snake: environment by cloning the `environment.yml`.
 
* Cloning or forking this repository, without modification, and activating Pages (i.e. automatically defining a sequence of Github Actions) will deploy the site. Like other Jekyll sites, to deploy the site locally, you can do so with Ruby using gems :gem: and bundler as detailed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). :link: 

* :bangbang: Warning :bangbang: for MacOS :computer: users: it is advisable to use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your Ruby versions, as detailed [here](https://dev.to/luizgadao/easy-way-to-change-ruby-version-in-mac-m1-m2-and-m3-16hl).
